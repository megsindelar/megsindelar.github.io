description: "Implemented a realsense camera using OpenCV to communicate to a robotic arm where a purple pen is in space, and have the robotic arm move to and grab the pen."

The goal of this project was to locate a purple pen in space using OpenCV and grab it with a robotic arm.

"Video goes here"

Software: OpenCV, Python

Hardware: PincherX 100, Intel Realsense D435i

Using a realsense camera, I used computer vision techniques to identify the centroid purple pen by aligning the RGB image with the depth map.
